## My process

For this project, I focused on creating a responsive blog preview card using clean and efficient HTML and CSS. My approach was to first design the layout structure in HTML, followed by styling it with CSS to ensure it looked polished, worked across different screen sizes and included a hover state and focus state.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project taught me several key concepts:
- Focus States: Adding focus states to ensure accessibility and usability for keyboard users.
- CSS Box Shadows: I practiced creating neat shadow effects to add depth to the card.
- Media Queries: Writing mobile-friendly CSS and ensuring the layout adjusts well for smaller screen sizes. 
- Hover and Transition Effects: Adding a smooth color and scale transition for interactive elements to improve user experience.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I aim to:
- Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Improve accessibility features by adding ARIA attributes where needed.
- Implement JavaScript for interactivity, such as a dark mode toggle.
